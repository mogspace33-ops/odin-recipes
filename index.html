        <h1>The Recipe Book</h1>
        <p>Some times we want to get a recipe to a meal but we find ourselves lost in the internet.</p>
        <p>This website aims to solve this problem by providing some main meal recipes so you know your destination the next time you are searching for a recipe.</p>
        <h1>The Recipes</h1>
        <h2>Rice</h2>
        <p>As an egyption I can say that rice isn't a side dish it's almost presented in <b>every</b> table here. 
        </p>
        <p>But yea ,I know that sometimes you get bores from that plain white look so let's present the basic recipe aside to other <b>interesting</b> recipes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>White Rice</li>
            <p>     The basic plain <a href="pages/whiterice.html" rel="norefferer"><b>White Rice</b></a> can still be very tricky yet you will need to cock
                 it <b>alot</b> of times.</p>
            <li>Lemon-Herb Rice</li>
            <p>     This amazing <a href="pages/lemonrice.html" rel="norefferer"><b>Lemon-Herb Rice Pilaf</b></a> recipe has enough going on to be <B>The Main Event</B>, also can be great aside chicken or fish</p>
            <li>Stuffed Peppers</li>
            <p>     Egyption <strong>loves</strong> to stuff alot of things, For now we will cover the <a href="pages/stuffedpepperrice.html" rel="norefferer"><b>Stuffed Peppers</b></a>, and if you like it you will find the 
            other stuffed dishes or as we call <B>mahshi</B> in the Egyption Food section. </p>
            <li>Paella</li>
            <p>     It's mainly a Spanish meal and the <a href="pages/paellarice.html" rel="norefferer"><b>paella</b></a> is relly delicious, I think it's funny that we call it in egypt <b>roz saiadea</b> which means 
                fishermen rice.
