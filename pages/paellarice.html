    <h1>Classic Paella</h1>

    <p>In my book, the best kind of tradition is to invite close friends over, have a bottle of rioja (or, my favorite, Txacolina, if you want a refreshing white for a hot summer evening), and share a homemade dish from the heart. Come summertime, paella is just the thing. This Spanish dish is a guaranteed crowd-pleasing centerpiece for special occasions and parties, but honestly, this dish is enough reason to celebrate all on its own. With its beautiful and impactful presentation, I wouldn’t be surprised if a few tears are shed when you serve it. While it might not be the simplest dish in the world, it also really isn’t as scary to make as you may think. Plus, its signature taste, texture, and jaw-dropping look is more than worth the effort it requires.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb. Spanish chorizo, cut into 1" pieces</li>
        <li>1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1" pieces</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 plum tomatoes, grated on the large holes of a box grater, skins and core discarded</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp. saffron threads</li>
        <li>6 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups (400 g.) bomba rice</li>
        <li>1 lb. large shrimp, peeled, deveined</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>In a large, shallow skillet (at least 12") on your largest burner, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Cook chorizo, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate.
        <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>In same skillet over medium-high heat, cook chicken, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes; season with salt.
        <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>Move chicken to one side of pan; place tomatoes and garlic on other side. Cook, stirring occasionally to combine and adjusting heat as needed, until tomatoes have caramelized, about 5 minutes. Add paprika and saffron and cook, stirring, until warmed through, about 1 minute.
        <li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>Add broth and return chorizo and any accumulated juices to pan; season with salt. Bring to a boil, then add rice and mix until rice is covered by liquid. At this point, do not touch or mix the rice. Cook over high heat 5 minutes, then reduce heat to medium and cook 5 minutes more. Reduce heat to low, then cook, maintaining a gentle simmer for 15 minutes.
        <li><h3>Step 5</h3></li>Season shrimp with salt and add it over the rice. Keep the paella on a simmer for 10 more minutes or until rice is mostly absorbed and al dente. When it’s done you should hear a crackling sound, which means the rice is toasting. Poke through middle of rice with a knife or spoon to make sure it’s browning properly. Once deep golden brown, remove from heat and let sit 5 minutes before serving.
    </ol>
